# Collaboration Rules

## GIT
* When working on a new feature, create a new branch starting with `/feature/` + the name of your feature in lowercase, using dashes (-) for spaces;
* If you are working on a feature which is still a "work in process" (meaning that you are not done working on it), start your commit with `WIP:`;
* Feature branches will only be merged into the `master` branch after testing and reviewing that certain feature;
* When writing commits, use the imperative tense, **NOT the past tense**!
