# Collaboration Rules

## GIT
* When working on a new feature, create a new branch starting with `/feature/` + the name of your feature in lowercase, using dashes `-` for spaces;
* If you are working on a feature which is still a "work in process" (meaning that you are not done working on it), start your commit with `WIP:`;
* Feature branches will only be merged into the `master` branch after testing and reviewing that certain feature;
* When writing commits, use the imperative tense, not the past tense (Thanks Jose hehe).

## Github Projects
* Each repository has its own project: This is just so that we don't get confused in the long run.
* New issues (= tasks to work on) can be created by going to the repository => `Issues` => `New issue`.
  - Write a title for your issue, as well as a descriptive comment, if necessary.
  - Assign the issue to someone (it could be yourself, someone else or more than one person).
  - You can also assign existing labels to the issue (recommended).
  - You **MUST** add a project to the issue!
  - Newly opened issues will automatically be added to the "`To do`" column in the project.
  - Closed issues will automatically be added to the "`Done`" column in the project.
